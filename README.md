## My process

Hello, this is my 21st challenge and it is also my first FEM challenge using React. The concept of this challenge is straightforward but I struggled a bit especially when using "useEffect" hook because there are times that I am confused on why it is making it run, or what is the current snapshot it is using and it just hurts my head so much haaha. But I managed to pull it off and I am quite proud of myself about this. Looking forward to other challenges that I will tackle using React!!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Sass preprocessor
- React
- Gulp for SCSS pre-processing


### What I learned

I learned in this challenge the importance of well managed states in React. I wanted to use some reactContext but I thought that I could just use state itself and the local storage, since it is much better right. I also learned some other hooks to which I want to use in other projects. I also implemented my own drag and drop  :>>

### Continued development

I want to practice more about React!!
